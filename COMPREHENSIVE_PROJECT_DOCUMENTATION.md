### Data Flow Architecture

**Complete Processing Pipeline:**
```
User Upload → Temporary Storage → Content Extraction → AI Analysis → Results Storage → File Cleanup
     ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓            ↓              ↓

```

**Session State Management:**
```python
# Core data structures
session_state = {
    'reports_history': [],           # All processed reports
    'health_data': {},              # Current analysis data
    'prescriptions': [],            # Medication management
    'appointments': [],             # Appointment requests
    'lifestyle_quiz': {},           # Lifestyle assessment data
    'chat_history': [],             # AI conversation history
    'nearby_hospitals': [],         # Location-based search results
    'user_location': {}             # Geocoded user location
}
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Data Privacy Implementation

**Zero Permanent Storage Policy:**
- **Temporary Files**: All uploads deleted immediately after processing
- **Session-Only Data**: Health information exists only during active session
- **No Database**: No permanent storage of personal health information
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data

**File Security Model:**
```python
# Secure temporary file handling
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file:
    tmp_file.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
    file_path = tmp_file.name

try:
    # Process file securely
    result = process_document(file_path)
finally:
    # Guaranteed cleanup regardless of processing outcome
    os.unlink(file_path)
```

**API Security:**
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored securely
- **Encrypted Communications**: HTTPS for all external API calls
- **Request Timeout**: Configured timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data exposed in error messages

### Medical Data Compliance

**Healthcare Standards:**
- **HIPAA Awareness**: Designed with privacy regulations in mind
- **Professional Disclaimers**: Clear medical advice limitations
- **Data Minimization**: Only process necessary information
- **User Consent**: Clear privacy notices and user acknowledgment

**Safety Features:**
- **No Diagnosis**: Explicitly avoid medical diagnosis claims
- **Professional Referral**: Consistent reminders to consult healthcare providers
- **Limitation Notices**: Clear statements about informational purpose only
- **Emergency Warnings**: Directions for urgent medical situations
